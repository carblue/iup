Re: Build error on Linux

Hello, folks--

I very much appreciate Your work on IUP, CD, IM and the design goals. Unfortunately I only recently "discovered" IUP for
use from D programming language (Binding: https://bitbucket.org/alphaglosined/libglosined/src/ and my own).

First of all, this is my OS: Linux319_64 (in package notation), Kubuntu 15.10 (up to date from repo, liblua5.1-0 runtime, libgtk-3-dev (3.14.13-0ubuntu1)
, libgtk2.0-0 runtime installed but NOT libgtk2.0-dev)

I had trouble to build an IUP installation from sources too, but this thread helped a lot to succeed finally.
Here are my suggestions for changes in documentation (iup-3.17_Docs.pdf) and sources:

"Building Lua, IM, CD and IUP in Linux", page 90
After installing prerequisites (for building all libraries; libgtk3.0-dev doesn't exist, but libgtk-3-dev does), Unpacking:
cd-5.8.2_Sources.tar.gz
im-3.9.1_Sources.tar.gz
iup-3.15_Sources.tar.gz
lua-5.3_Sources.tar.gz

"If you want to use some of these libraries that are installed on the system you will have to define some environment variables before building them."
The meaning wasn't clear to me, so I defined the environment variables mentioned, and ran in build errors.
So I took the meaning as "libraries that are already installed by a previous installation" and NOT "going to be installed".

Lua, page 92
As the already installed Lua (only runtime, nothing else) is version 5.1 and I downloaded lua-5.3_Sources.tar.gz, I decided to go with the newer
version 5.3 and defined USE_LUA53=Yes in the environment (export USE_LUA53=Yes  in .bashrc).

Building
There is no mention about building Lua now, so I decided to do this first.
Confusingly there is a Makefile in directory lua53/ as well as in lua53/src/
The README file for installation instructions points to doc/readme.html, that doesn't exist.
So I decided for: lua53$ make linux

Building Lua: liblua.a, lua and luac got built successfully.

Building IM: im/src$ make
============
Build error is:
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -llua53

Obviously I made a mistake with lua, corrected as a workaround by:
lua53/src/$ sudo cp liblua.a /usr/local/lib/liblua53.a

The bulk of compiler warnings is confusing, but finally libimlua_fftw53.so got built successfully.

Building CD: cd/src$ make
============
Again, the bulk of compiler warnings and even errors is confusing, but finally:
../tecmake.mak:1468: recipe for target '../lib/Linux319_64/libcdcontextplus.so' failed
Build error is:
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lcdx11

This is where I came across this thread and changed Makefile like this:
cd/src$ diff -u Makefile_original Makefile

        @$(TECMAKE_CMD) MF=cd_zlib        

Now make runs until finally building libcdluaim53.so successfully.

Building IUP: iup$ make
=============
Again, the bulk of compiler warnings and even errors is confusing, but finally:
gtk/iupgtk_dialog.c: In function ‘gtkDialogSetTrayImageAttrib’:
gtk/iupgtk_dialog.c:1045:3: error: unknown type name ‘GtkStatusIcon’
   GtkStatusIcon* status_icon = gtkDialogGetStatusIcon(ih);
...   
../tecmake.mak:1583: recipe for target '../obj/Linux319_64/iupgtk_dialog.o' failed

The reason for that turned out to be the same as for Matt Gushee's workaround:
/usr/include/gtk-3.0/gtk/gtk.h includes some deprecated files (among others that for ‘GtkStatusIcon’) only, if
GTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED is not defined;

So, DEFINES += GTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED seems to be risky to break building iup, if not closely following and adapt to updates of gtk.

I changed iupgtk_dialog.c like this:
iup/src/gtk$ diff -u iupgtk_dialog_original.c  iupgtk_dialog.c

+                                 TODO:  */
 #include <gtk/gtk.h>
 
 #ifdef HILDON

Next, make error:
Tecmake: linking iupview ...
g++: error: ../../lua53/lib/Linux319_64/liblua53.a: File or directory not found
../tecmake.mak:1515: recipe for target '../bin/Linux319_64/iupview' failed

So I manually created that file and make finishes successfully:
Tecmake: Application (../bin/Linux319_64/iuplua53) Done.

Installation (System Directory)
===============================
I personally comletely avoid installing manually in /usr except in /usr/local und prefer building a .deb-package for install (using checkinstall),
but that only works with an install target in a Makefile.

It's sad, that iup is close to a smooth build on Linux, but in the current situation some people may give up earlier.
