This folder has to be populated with .lib files, to be downloaded from (adapt links to new versions):

https://sourceforge.net/projects/canvasdraw/files/5.9/Windows%20Libraries/Dynamic/cd-5.9_Win64_dll14_lib.zip/download

DMD for 86_64 uses the MS Visual Studio linker and it's COFF-formatted import libraries, thus we have to stick with MS's .lib files.
This will probably introduce some vcruntime???.dll dependency on top of MSVCRT.DLL: vcruntime140.dll in this case too !
