This folder has to be populated with .lib files (generated from .dll files):

.dll files to be downloaded from (adapt to Your compiler/linker, but stick with Windows x86 here; I prefer dependency on MSVCRT.DLL only, but if You have a vcruntime???.dll dependency anyway, take a VS related download!):

https://sourceforge.net/projects/iup/files/3.20/Windows%20Libraries/Dynamic/iup-3.20_Win32_dllw4_lib.zip/download
https://sourceforge.net/projects/canvasdraw/files/5.11/Windows%20Libraries/Dynamic/cd-5.11_Win32_dllw4_lib.zip/download
https://sourceforge.net/projects/imtoolkit/files/3.12/Windows%20Libraries/Dynamic/im-3.12_Win32_dllw4_lib.zip/download

.lib files to be generated with Digital Mars tool : implib
http://www.digitalmars.com/ctg/implib.html

To create the import library e.g. iup.lib from iup.dll, run:
implib /s iup.lib iup.dll

You will need at least iup.lib and iupcontrols.lib
