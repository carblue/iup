arch=x86_64
This folder has to be populated with .lib files, to be downloaded from (see below):
(Optionally also place the .dll here as well and (mandatory) to some location within %PATH% if You opt for dynamic linkage)

For example:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/iup/files/3.29/Windows%20Libraries/Dynamic/iup-3.29_Win64_dll15_lib.zip/download
https://sourceforge.net/projects/canvasdraw/files/5.13/Windows%20Libraries/Dynamic/cd-5.13_Win64_dll15_lib.zip/download
https://sourceforge.net/projects/imtoolkit/files/3.14/Windows%20Libraries/Dynamic/im-3.14_Win64_dll15_lib.zip/download

DMD for x86_64 uses the MS Visual Studio linker and it's COFF-formatted (import) libraries, thus we have to stick with MS's .lib files.
This will introduce a dependency on top of MSVCRT.DLL: VCRUNTIME140.DLL in this case too !

You will need at least iup.lib, possibly also ftgl.lib and iupcontrols.lib and likely more

appveyor.yml: image: Visual Studio 2017; *_dll15_lib.zip are exact matches
