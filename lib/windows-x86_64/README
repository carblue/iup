arch=x86_64
This folder has to be populated with .lib files, to be downloaded from (adapt to Your compiler/linker, but stick with Windows x86_64 (Win64) here):
(Optionally also place the .dll here as well)

For example:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/iup/files/3.25/Windows%20Libraries/Dynamic/iup-3.25_Win64_dll14_lib.zip/download
https://sourceforge.net/projects/canvasdraw/files/5.11.1/Windows%20Libraries/Dynamic/cd-5.11.1_Win64_dll14_lib.zip/download
https://sourceforge.net/projects/imtoolkit/files/3.12/Windows%20Libraries/Dynamic/im-3.12_Win64_dll14_lib.zip/download

DMD for x86_64 uses the MS Visual Studio linker and it's COFF-formatted import libraries, thus we have to stick with MS's .lib files.
This will introduce some vcruntime???.dll dependency on top of MSVCRT.DLL: vcruntime140.dll in this case too !

You will need at least iup.lib and iupcontrols.lib
